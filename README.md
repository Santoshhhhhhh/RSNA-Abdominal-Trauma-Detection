The RSNA Abdominal Trauma Detection AI Challenge aims to improve the rapid and accurate 
diagnosis of traumatic abdominal injuries, a major global health concern. Trauma is a leading cause 
of death among young individuals, with over 5 million annual global deaths. Computed tomography 
(CT) scans play a pivotal role in evaluating abdominal injuries, but interpretation can be intricate, 
particularly when multiple injuries or subtle bleeding are involved. This challenge calls for the 
development of AI algorithms to assist medical professionals in swiftly and precisely identifying and 
grading abdominal injuries, potentially revolutionizing trauma care and patient outcomes. The 
competition focuses on detecting injuries in the liver, spleen, kidneys, and bowel, and identifying 
active internal bleeding, using weighted log loss as the evaluation metric
